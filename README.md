# Every_Stock_Sentiment

This script looks for every stock listed in the NYSE and NASDAQ (8000+ stocks) and gives its sentiment value (bullish or bearish) in order
to decide whether to buy or sell.

Note: This software is not complete, every 200 requests the stocktwits server (the website that gives sentiment values) will not send
back information to out IP. I'm currently working on implementing a VPN whenever that error occurs.
